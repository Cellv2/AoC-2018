# AoC-2018

A repo for my Advent of Code 2018 solutions

## Getting output

You will need NodeJS installed. Please run the individual JS files in node. This can be done by:

* Cloning the repo
* Navidating to the folder in cmd
* Typing _node_ then the path to the file from the root. To run day 1 part 1, for example, do this:
  * _node day_1\part_1.js_

Alternatively, you could copy the JavaScript out of the file and run it in the browser, but you would need to make your own array from the input.
